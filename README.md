# AI-1-Higs-bosson-Clasiification
This project has been done under course AI - 1 (Univ.ai).
It was a [kaggle challange](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/higgs-boson
).

## Problem statement

In LHC (large hadron collider), when protons are collided with each other, the collision is known as events.
These event data contains features like type, direction, energy. These features are used to create set of variables on which the events can be classified as significant or insignificant, here **signal** or **background**.
when an event is unique and its feature space is disconnected from the ones previously observed in past experiments, a new particle deems to be discovered.
Therefore, classification of these events holds lot of scope for future studies and experiments of the events classified as signal.
